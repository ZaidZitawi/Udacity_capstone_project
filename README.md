## üß™ Testing

To run unit tests for the app using **Jest**, execute:  
```bash
NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules npm run test --detectOpenHandles
```

---

## üõ† Build & Development

To set up **webpack** and start your development environment, follow these steps:

1. First, build your project to create the `dist` folder:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Then, start the development server with webpack:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Finally, you can run both the development server and Express simultaneously for hot reloading and a working backend:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
   - The app will run at **http://localhost:4007**.

This will ensure that both your **frontend** (with hot reloading) and **backend** (Express) are up and running smoothly during development.

### üåü Key Notes:
- **Ensure your Node.js version is v20.12.2** to avoid compatibility issues.
- The `.env` file should be kept private and not included in any public repositories.
- API keys are required to run the app; sign up on the respective API provider websites to get them.
- **Ensure Run** `npm run build`to create the dist folder, then `npm run dev` for development, and `npm run start` to run both webpack and Express with hot reloading.
